WIP. Please stand by for some in-depth updates.

To utilize the Orbital Cannon, as this has an issue with initializing on startup, run the following:
```
/reload
/give @s amethyst_shard[max_stack_size=1,item_name='"Orbital Cannon Trigger"',custom_data={orbital:true},food={nutrition:0,saturation:0,can_always_eat:true,eat_seconds:99999999}] 1
```
